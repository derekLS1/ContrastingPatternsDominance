# ContrastingPatternsDominance
code used in "Contrasting Patterns of Microbial Dominance in the Arabidopsis thaliana Phyllosphere"


I wrote code in bash and R for analysis of various forms of data used in the above paper. 
I am self taught and a bit sloppy (though slowly improving)

I am not intending to make user friendly code here, but saving and documenting what I used. 

I am happy to answer any questions and help you get the existing code working if that is your goal!
